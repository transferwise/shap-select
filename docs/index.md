## Repo created from the dev portal

A library for feature selection for gradient boosting models using regression on feature Shapley values

## Getting started

Start writing your documentation by adding more markdown (.md) files to this folder (/docs) or replace the content in this file.

## Table of Contents

The Table of Contents on the right is generated automatically based on the hierarchy
of headings. Only use one H1 (`#` in Markdown) per file.

## Site navigation

For new pages to appear in the left hand navigation you need edit the `mkdocs.yml`
file in root of your repo. The navigation can also link out to other sites.

Alternatively, if there is no `nav` section in `mkdocs.yml`, a navigation section
will be created for you. However, you will not be able to use alternate titles for
pages, or include links to other sites.

Note that MkDocs uses `mkdocs.yml`, not `mkdocs.yaml`, although both appear to work.
